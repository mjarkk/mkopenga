# USB C to Displayport 1.4

_(In search of a USB C to Displayport 1.4 80k 60hz)_

I have an ultrawide 1440p 144hz monitor with 3 inputs, 1 displayport and 2 HDMI ports.

The HDMI version of this monitor is to low to even support 1440p 144hz, so i'm required to use DP (Displayport).

On my pc this issn't a big issue as it has a DP 1.4 output but my laptop (Mabook Pro with m chip)
only has usb c ports and 1 hdmi port with hdmi version 2.0.

It seems like i need either one of 2 things to use my display on my macbook.

1. A active hdmi 2.0 to displayport 1.4 adapter.
2. A usb c to displayport 1.4 cable or dongle.

I haven't yet tried option 1 yet but i might do that some day.

I've focused on option 2 for now.

But finding a converter that can actually do 1440p 144hz is a bit of a challenge.
The internet is full of converts that only convert to displayport 1.2 or AlternateMode 1.4 and even worse a lot of false advertising.

Here is what i found so far.

## Tested and working converters:

- [Club3D - USB Type C to DisplayPort 1.4 8K60Hz HBR3 Active Adapter](https://www.club-3d.com/en/detail/2487/usb_type_c_to_displayport_1.4_8k60hz_hbr3_active_adapter/) I also have cabels from this brand and all have worked flawlessly.
- [MAXONAR - USB C to DisplayPort Cable 8K60Hz](https://maxonar.com/collections/usb-c-usb4/products/usb-c-to-pd-1-4?variant=39600025010264) (mine is 4Ft)
- [StarTech - USB-C naar DisplayPort 1.4 kabel - 8K 60Hz](https://www.startech.com/nl-nl/beeldscherm-videoadapters/cdp2dp141mb) Broke after a few months but it did worked

## Seem interesting but have not tested:

- [Club3D - USB Type C Cable to DP 1.4 8K60Hz](https://www.club-3d.com/en/detail/2470/usb_type_c_cable_to_dp_1.4_8k60hz_m-m_1.8m-5.9ft/) Branch seems to be good.
- [Linq - LQ48024 8K/60Hz USB-C to DisplayPort Pro](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1904006/linq-lq48024-8k-60hz-usb-c-to-displayport-pro-cable-2m-zwart.html) Note that this one is 2m long and i'm not sure if it will work.
- [StarTech - USB-C naar DisplayPort adapter met USB Power Delivery 60W - 4K 60Hz](https://www.startech.com/nl-nl/beeldscherm-videoadapters/cdp2dpucp) The powerdelivery element seems interesting for my laptop usecase but as my other StarTech cabel failed i'm a bit sceptical
- [MAXONAR - USB C to DisplayPort 1.4 Adapter](https://maxonar.com/collections/usb-c-usb4/products/usb-c-to-displayport-1-4-8k-adapter) My current cabel from MAXONAR is working fine.

## Notes / Important

- The longer the cabel the more change you it won't work or is a scam
- You need 8k 60hz NOT 8k 30hz those seems to use AlternateMode.
