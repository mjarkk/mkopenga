# Favorite media

I'm quite dyslexic so language is quite hard for me. _As you can probably see from this website._

Tough i don't have mutch problems with listening to media so that's usually my prefered way of learning new things.

Some channels that made me think and see the world in a different way.

There is way more media that changed my mind about things but these are some channels where lots of videos made me explore new things.

These channels have learned me a lot of things.

The topcis are very diffrent from in dept news videos to a story about Nascar's Talladega track.

These have a lot overlap with other categories but every channel under here has such diffrent content that's it's hard to tell exacly what kind of channel they are.

Personally i don't really like history but when someone speaks about it with passion some
topics most things can become very interesting.

There are more channels under here that explain lots of history topics but usually they have some sort of point to make or a philosophical underline.

These are 2 very diffrent channels.

The first channel is a channel that talks about video game reviews in a _maybe_ way to in depth way.
It opened my eyes to detials i never noticed before and it has changed the way i treat games.

The second one is "just" a channel that presends games &-ideas in a very fun way.
And i have enjoyed all video so far.

These are some channels i like to watch programming related videos of.

Except Level 1 Tech/Linux i mainly like the host(s) of these channels they seem like people that are very interested and knowlaged in the topics they cover.

Ya i know climate change feels like bs but we have to deal with it one way or another.

The first channel made me discover a lot of things about climate change i did not know before so i tought it's a worth entry here.

The second one speaks a lot about E-Biking especially in America, as i'm from the Netherlands biking is just a normal thing but it suprised how people in other countries think about biking.
This channel was a big eye opener for me.
