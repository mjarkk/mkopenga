# Biking all of Groningen

_What i've driven so far, (yellow are the roads where i've been)_

![map image](/biking_map.webp "map image")

Somewhere in 2023 i tought it was a great idea to ride trough EVERY street in the city of Groningen.

Since i have a bike with the [Bosch smart system](https://www.bosch-ebike.com/us/products/the-smart-system) the app for my bike tracks all rides.
It has wondered me for years already how manny streets do i actually visit of the city where i live.

So after a long time thinking about it i finally decided to import all rides into a map and see where i've written.
To my disapointment i discoverd that i've bearly seen any of the city i live in.

Since then i've started to ride trough the city and try to visit as manny streets as possible.

## Tracking rides

At first i used the [Bosch Flow App](https://www.bosch-ebike.com/us/products/ebike-flow-app) but i've found a few problems with it tracking my rides.

The first problem is that exporting the rides is very annoying.. I need to export every ride one by one and it takes around 10 taps to export a single ride to my Google Drive.
I would like to export rides to my phone's storage but the [Bosch Flow App](https://www.bosch-ebike.com/us/products/ebike-flow-app) only allows me to export rides to a Cloud Storage like why ðŸ˜ .

Another problem is that i'm limited to tracking when i'm riding my bike, as my end goal is to have visited all of Groningen i must walk some part and i cannot do that with the [Bosch Flow App](https://www.bosch-ebike.com/us/products/ebike-flow-app).

Beside these practical problems i also discoverd that the tracking rate is quite slow (I think it records a tracking point every 5 seconds) and for small streets i might be quicker trought the street than the App adds a tracking location.

So after some time trying other apps i discoverd [Geo Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ilyabogdanovich.geotracker) the most generic name every i know
but the app seems to respect my privacy and have all the options i ever need for tracking my rides.
I've bought their the pro subscription for 0.60 euro's a month so i can use the [MapBox maps](https://www.mapbox.com/) within the app over Google their maps as i like their style more.

### How do i ride?

I use Android's split screen function to place a screenshot of where i've been and the
[Geo Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ilyabogdanovich.geotracker) below to see where i'm currently riding.

This is not an ideal setup as apps get very very very small when using split screen.
I might have a big phone [Google Pixel 7](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_7-11903.php) but still it kinda works.

I don't use a phone mount on my bike i rather just have my phone in my pocket and pull it out every second street to see where i should go.

There is also the problem that i'm a cheap boii and i have a pre paid sim card so internet on the road is basicly not a thing for me.
So maps need to be available offline. Mapbox seems to not have offline support but when pre zooming in at home with wifi the map seems to be cached and i can use it offline.

## Showing all my rides on a map

This was a challenge and futer below i will get to the technical details but first i will explain in a broad way how i do it.

I firstly export all my rides in the [Geo Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ilyabogdanovich.geotracker) app to [GPX files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format).

Then i move the files to my desktop using [LocalSend](https://localsend.org/#/).

On my PC i run a program over all the [GPX files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format) and convert them to a single csv file with all location points i've ever been.
This program also remove points that are close very close to each other for example 2 points that are within 1 meter distance of each other do not really make a difference on a map so close together points get removed.

I've made a website that uses [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) to show a map and overlay the points using their APIs.

As the points are so close together they will quickly start to look like lines when zoomed out, see the image above for an example.
I would like to one day change convert these into lines but when you've driven over 1000 times trough 1 street they get a bit messy with GPS points
so converting those to lines is a bit of a challenge that i'm still thinking about.
