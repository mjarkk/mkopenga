# Phone journey

So a long time ago i got my first phone and ever since i have been very opinionated since about phones.

Over time i have noticed my opinion changing radically and i want to explore this more and meanwhile document my journey.

All phones here are from newest (top) to oldest (bottom)

## Nexus 5x

I mainly got this phone so 

## Sony Xperia Z Ultra

I got some money this time to buy a somewhat good phone. This phone was ridiculously cheap for what i got it was 300 euro from what i can remember.

I think i know why.. because it had the size of 3 iphone 5's and was a absolute unit. Calling was just wired it looked like walking with a tabel beside my ear and from this point on i always checked if my phone fits in my pocket.

But beside that this was the best phone i've had.

It was one of the fastest phones for the time, it had a great amound of storage, it had a great camera and it was even waterproof.
The Android version (4.4) it was up to date and even got updates something i've never had til this point (for a while at least).

Sonys android skin made android better, it did not have to much bloat and what it added was mostly usefull.

This was the first phone i installed a custom rom on using someone elses help and it was great.
I installed cynogenmod and the world that opened was massive i could install any app or mod i wanted.

### Opinion changes

- More Android good, iphone bad!
- Sony makes nice phones

### Good and bads

**Good:**

- Clean android skin with only usefull features
- Great camera
- System software updates
- A quick Quad core processor

**Bad:**

- It's enormous

## Samsung Galaxy Trend

I think i got this phone because my LG gt540 did not have enough ram,storage,cpu,etc..

From what i can remember this phone was more shit than my prevouse phone.

I'm not sure why this is the landscape changed quick back then and everyone around me had phones that could do more things.

I remember that this phone was stuck on Android 4.1 was was a limiting factor for a lot of cool features.

This phone had a lot of pre installed Samsung bloat i could not un-install to get more room for apps and was limited by it's features as it was released with Android 4.1.
This brought me to the sene of installing a custom ROM on a phone. I wanted that so badly as it clould allow me to run anroid 4.4 and allow me to install a lot more applications.

Sadly this phone was shit and thus there where almost no roms.
After buying another phone i finally found a way to install a custom rom but sadly the rom was shit an a lot of things did not work like the camera.

### Opinion changes

- All phones with a fuckload of bloat are bad.
- Android good, iphone bad!

### Good and bads

**Good:**

- It worked

**Bad:**

- No updates while the top samsung phones got updates
- Bloat


## LG gt540

My first phone, It was absolute shit.

I belive it had Android 2.1 and it was the cheapest android phone one could buy that time in a shop.

Even tough is was a absolute shit phone i had a great time with my first phone.

### Opinion changes

This phone made me more excited about tech.
Before this i had an MP4 player that had not that many features but now i had an App store _(google play store did not exsists yet)_, i could access the internet, i could talk with anyone via whatsapp.
It was great.

### Good and bads

**Good:**

- First phone
- It's a brick, it still lives
- Cheap(ish)

**Bad:**

- Everything
- Touch detection was shit
- Camera was shit
- Absolute no storage, i could only install 2-4 apps before the storage was full.
